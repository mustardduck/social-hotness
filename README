Social Hotness is a Google chrome browser extension that automatically
finds hot spots (e.g. ``219 comments'', ``3344 points'') on social web
sites, and highlights the spots using different shades of color based
on the relative hotness.

Install the extension and head to http://news.ycombinator.com to see
