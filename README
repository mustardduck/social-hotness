Social Hotness is a Google chrome browser extension that automatically
finds hot spots (e.g. ``219 comments'', ``3344 points'') on social web
sites, and highlights the spots using different shades of color based
on the relative hotness.

It's useful because it saves your time! It makes it easier to pick up
the most valuable content on the page so that you can skim the rest.

See the screenshot to get a feel how it works:
